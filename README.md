# belly-button-challenge
I've built an interactive dashboard as required for this assignment.
I've also deployed it on GitHub Pages (https://harshh1412.github.io/belly-button-challenge/).
The default visualizations are that of the first ID number i.e. 940.
To see the demographic info, bar chart and bubble chart of other ID numbers, simply select it from the drop-down menu under the text "Test Subject ID Number:".
The script for this webpage is in the static/js folder, named "app.js". It is thoroughly commented to showcase the logic/purpose of the commands used.
